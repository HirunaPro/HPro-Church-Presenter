## 💡 Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Small Church, Sunday Services Only
**Recommendation:** Azure Container Instances ⭐

- **Why:** Lowest cost ($0.57/month)
- **Setup:** Deploy once, start before service, stop after
- **Workflow:**
  ```bash
  # Sunday 9:00 AM
  .\start-container.ps1
  
  # During service (10:00-12:00)
  # Use operator interface
  
  # After service (12:30 PM)
  .\stop-container.ps1
  ```

### Scenario 2: Church with Midweek Services (Sun + Wed)
**Recommendation:** Azure Container Instances ⭐

- **Why:** Still very cheap ($1.14/month)
- **Setup:** Same as Scenario 1, just use twice a week

### Scenario 3: Church with Daily Prayer Meetings
**Recommendation:** App Service Basic (B1)

- **Why:** Always-on is more convenient
- **Cost:** $13/month (or $3-4/month with smart stop/start)
- **Benefit:** No need to manually start/stop

### Scenario 4: Multiple Services, Need Professional Setup
**Recommendation:** App Service Basic (B1)

- **Why:** SSL, custom domain, professional URLs
- **Setup:** One-time deployment, always available
- **Example:** https://worship.yourchurch.org

### Scenario 5: Testing/Development
**Recommendation:** Local Docker or App Service Free

- **Why:** Test without cost
- **Note:** Free tier has limitations, but good for testing

### Scenario 6: Large Church, High Traffic
**Recommendation:** App Service Standard (S1) or Premium

- **Why:** Auto-scaling, better performance
- **Cost:** $69-140/month
- **Features:** Multiple instances, traffic manager

## 📈 Cost Optimization Strategies

### Container Instances
```bash
# Automated start/stop with Azure Automation
# Schedule:
# - Start: Sunday 9:00 AM, Wednesday 6:00 PM
# - Stop: Sunday 1:00 PM, Wednesday 9:00 PM
# Result: $1.14/month instead of $35/month
```

### App Service Basic
```bash
# Stop when not needed
# 4 days/month running = $1.70/month
# 8 days/month running = $3.40/month

# Commands:
az webapp stop --name mychurch-app --resource-group church-rg
az webapp start --name mychurch-app --resource-group church-rg
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Between Options

### From Container to App Service
```bash
# Deploy to App Service
.\deploy-to-azure-v2.ps1 -AppName "mychurch-app"

# Keep container as backup
# Stop container to avoid costs
az container stop --resource-group church-presenter-rg --name mychurch-app
```

### From App Service to Container
```bash
# Deploy to Container
.\deploy-azure-container.ps1 -AppName "mychurch-app"

# Delete App Service to avoid costs
az webapp delete --name mychurch-app --resource-group church-rg
```

### Running Both (Blue-Green)
```bash
# Container for production
# App Service for testing
# Switch DNS when ready
```
