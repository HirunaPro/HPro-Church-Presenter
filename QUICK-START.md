## Troubleshooting

- Make sure `.json` files are in the `songs/` folder
- Refresh the operator page
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Can't connect from another device?
- Both devices must be on the same WiFi network
- Use the IP address shown when server starts (not localhost)
- Check firewall settings

### Port already in use error?
- Another instance of the server is running
- Close all Python processes:
  - Windows Task Manager â†’ Find Python â†’ End Task
  - Or run: `taskkill /F /IM python.exe` in Command Prompt
- Try starting the server again

### Server won't start?
