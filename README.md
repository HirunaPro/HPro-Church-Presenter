## Installation

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed:
- Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

### 2. Install Dependencies

Open a terminal/command prompt in the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install websockets
```

## Running the Application

### Windows

Simply double-click `start.bat` in the project folder, or run:

```bash
start.bat
```

### macOS/Linux

Run the Python server directly:

```bash
python3 server.py
```

## Usage

### 1. Start the Server

Run the startup script. You'll see output showing the local IP address, for example:

```
HTTP Server running on:
  - http://localhost:8000
  - http://192.168.1.100:8000

WebSocket Server running on:
  - ws://localhost:8765
  - ws://192.168.1.100:8765

Access the application at:
  http://192.168.1.100:8000/index.html
```

### 2. Open the Landing Page

On the host computer, open a web browser and navigate to:
- `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

### 3. Open Operator Control

Click "Open Operator Control" or navigate to:
- `operator.html`

This is where you'll control what appears on the projector.

### 4. Open Projector Display

On the computer connected to the projector, open a web browser and navigate to:
- `http://[YOUR-IP]:8000/projector.html`

Replace `[YOUR-IP]` with the IP address shown when you started the server.

Press **F11** for full-screen mode.

## Operator Controls

### Song Selection
1. Use the search box to filter songs by title
2. Click a song to load its verses
3. Click any verse to display it on the projector (displays 4-6 lines at once)

### Font Size
- **Small**: 36px
- **Medium**: 48px (default)
- **Large**: 64px
- **Extra Large**: 80px

### Simple Slides
- **Welcome**: Displays welcome message
- **Sermon in Progress**: For during sermons
- **Prayer Time**: For prayer sessions
- **Announcements**: For announcements
- **Blank Screen**: Shows a black screen
- **Custom Text**: Enter custom text (e.g., Bible verses) and click "Show Custom Text"

### Connection Status
The connection indicator shows:
- **Green (Connected)**: WebSocket is connected to projector
- **Red (Disconnected)**: Connection lost (will auto-reconnect)

## Adding Songs

Songs are stored as JSON files in the `songs/` directory.

### Song File Format (Multi-Line Verses)

The app now supports displaying multiple lines at once (4-6 lines per verse). Create a new `.json` file in the `songs/` folder:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Song Title",
  "phrases": [
    [
      "First line of verse 1",
      "Second line of verse 1",
      "Third line of verse 1",
      "Fourth line of verse 1"
    ],
    [
      "First line of verse 2",
      "Second line of verse 2",
      "Third line of verse 2",
      "Fourth line of verse 2"
    ]
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The old single-line format is still supported for backward compatibility:
```json
{
  "title": "Your Song Title",
  "phrases": [
    "Single line 1",
    "Single line 2"
  ]
}
```

**See [MULTI-LINE-SONG-FORMAT.md](MULTI-LINE-SONG-FORMAT.md) for detailed guide and examples.**

### Naming Convention
- Use lowercase letters
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Example: `amazing-grace.json`

### Example

File: `songs/joyful-joyful.json`

```json
{
  "title": "Joyful, Joyful We Adore Thee",
  "phrases": [
    [
      "Joyful, joyful we adore Thee",
      "God of glory, Lord of love",
      "Hearts unfold like flowers before Thee",
      "Opening to the sun above"
    ],
    [
      "All Thy works with joy surround Thee",
      "Earth and heaven reflect Thy rays",
      "Stars and angels sing around Thee",
      "Center of unbroken praise"
    ]
  ]
}
```

After adding a song file, refresh the operator page to load it.

## Customization

### Change Church Name

Edit `js/operator.js` and find this line:

```javascript
const CHURCH_NAME = "Our Church"; // Configurable
```

Change `"Our Church"` to your church's name.

### Change Church Logo

Replace `images/church-logo.png` with your own logo image. Recommended size: 150x150 pixels.

### Modify Default Welcome Message

Edit `js/operator.js` and `js/projector.js` to change the default welcome message.

### Customize Slide Messages

In `js/operator.js`, find the slide button event handlers to modify default slide text:

```javascript
case 'welcome':
    content.text = `Welcome to ${CHURCH_NAME}`;
    break;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Operator shows "Disconnected"**
- Check that the server is running
- Verify the WebSocket port (8765) is not blocked by firewall
- Refresh the page

**Projector not receiving updates**
- Ensure both devices are on the same WiFi network
- Check the WebSocket connection in browser console (F12)
- Verify the IP address is correct

### Songs Not Loading

- Check that song files are in the `songs/` directory
- Verify JSON syntax is correct (use a JSON validator)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Ensure song files have `.json` extension

### Python/Server Issues

**"Python is not recognized"**
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure "Add to PATH" was checked during installation
- Restart your terminal/command prompt

**"Module 'websockets' not found"**
- Run: `pip install websockets`
- Or use the included `start.bat` which installs it automatically

**Port already in use**
- Change the port in `server.py`:
  ```python
  HTTP_PORT = 8000  # Change to different port
  WEBSOCKET_PORT = 8765  # Change to different port
  ```

## Network Setup

### Finding Your IP Address

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your active network adapter.

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
```
or
```bash
ip addr show
```

### Firewall Configuration

If other devices can't connect:

**Windows:**
1. Open Windows Defender Firewall
2. Click "Allow an app through firewall"
3. Allow Python through both Private and Public networks

**macOS:**
1. System Preferences → Security & Privacy → Firewall
2. Click "Firewall Options"
3. Add Python to allowed applications
