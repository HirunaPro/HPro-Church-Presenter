# Azure Quota Issue - Solutions Guide

## ‚ùå Problem
You're getting this error:
```
Operation cannot be completed without additional quota.
Current Limit (Free VMs): 0
```

This means your Azure subscription doesn't have quota for App Service Plans.

---

## ‚úÖ **3 Solutions Available**

### **Option 1: Try Multiple Regions (FASTEST)** ‚ö°

Some regions may have available quota. Run the multi-region script:

```powershell
.\deploy-to-azure-multi-region.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Automatically tries 10+ different Azure regions
- Deploys to the first one with available quota
- Uses Basic B1 tier (~$13/month, or $0.43-2/month with start/stop)

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Fast - works immediately if any region has quota  
‚úÖ Same deployment as before  
‚úÖ Good performance  

**Cons:**
‚ùå May not find any available region  
‚ùå Slightly higher cost than Container Instances  

---

### **Option 2: Azure Container Instances (RECOMMENDED)** ‚≠ê

Uses different quota system - often works when App Service doesn't:

```powershell
.\deploy-to-azure-container.ps1
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Install Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
- Restart computer after installing Docker

**What it does:**
- Deploys your app as a Docker container
- Uses Azure Container Instances (different quota)
- Pay-per-use pricing (only pay when running)

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Different quota - usually available  
‚úÖ Pay only when running  
‚úÖ Very low cost ($1-2/month for typical church use)  
‚úÖ Easy to start/stop  

**Cons:**
‚ùå Requires Docker installation  
‚ùå Slightly more complex setup  

**Cost Estimate:**
- 3 hours/week (Sundays only): **$1.04/month**
- 6 hours/week (Sun + Wed): **$2.08/month**
- 24/7 (not recommended): **$17.50/month**

### **Option 3: Request Quota Increase (SLOW)**

Request Microsoft to increase your quota:

**Steps:**
1. Go to https://portal.azure.com
2. Click on "Support + troubleshooting" (question mark icon)
3. Click "Create a support request"
4. Select:
   - Issue type: **Service and subscription limits (quotas)**
   - Subscription: Your subscription
   - Quota type: **Compute-VM (cores-vCPUs) subscription limit increases**
5. Fill in details:
   - Location: Your region (e.g., East US)
   - Quota type: **Basic App Service Plan**
   - New limit: **1**
6. Submit request

**Wait:** 1-2 business days for approval

**Then run:**
```powershell
.\deploy-to-azure-b1.ps1
```

**Pros:**
‚úÖ Free quota increase  
‚úÖ Use original deployment method  

**Cons:**
‚ùå Takes 1-2 days  
‚ùå Not guaranteed approval

## üéØ **Recommended Approach**

### **Quick Path (Do This Now):**

1. **Try Option 1** first (multi-region):
   ```powershell
   .\deploy-to-azure-multi-region.ps1
   ```

2. **If that fails**, use **Option 2** (Container Instances):
   - Install Docker Desktop
   - Restart computer
   - Run: `.\deploy-to-azure-container.ps1`

3. **Meanwhile**, submit **Option 3** (quota request) for future deployments

### **Best Long-term Solution:**

**Azure Container Instances (Option 2)** is the best choice because:
- ‚úÖ Works on all subscriptions (no quota issues)
- ‚úÖ Lowest cost for church use ($1-2/month)
- ‚úÖ Only pay when running
- ‚úÖ Easy management (start/stop)

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### Multi-Region Deploy:
```powershell
.\deploy-to-azure-multi-region.ps1
```

### Container Deploy:
```powershell
# 1. Install Docker Desktop first!
# 2. Restart computer
# 3. Run:

## üÜò Need Help?

**If multi-region script fails:**
‚Üí Use Container Instances (it will work!)

**If you don't have Docker:**
‚Üí Download: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
‚Üí Install, restart, then run container script

**If everything fails:**
‚Üí Your subscription type may have restrictions
‚Üí Try a different subscription (Pay-As-You-Go)
‚Üí Or request quota increase and wait

## üìû What to Do RIGHT NOW

Run this command:

```powershell
.\deploy-to-azure-multi-region.ps1
