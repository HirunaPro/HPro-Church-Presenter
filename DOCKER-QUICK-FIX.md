## ‚úÖ Solution (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Start Docker Desktop
1. Press `Win` key on keyboard
2. Type "Docker Desktop"
3. Click on "Docker Desktop" app
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for it to fully start

### Step 2: Look for Whale Icon

- Look for a **whale icon** üêã
- Wait until the icon **stops moving/animating**

### Step 3: Verify Docker is Ready
```powershell
# In PowerShell, run:
docker ps
```

**Good output (Docker is ready):**
```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS     NAMES
```

**Bad output (Docker not ready yet):**
```
error during connect: ...
```
‚Üí Wait another minute and try again
